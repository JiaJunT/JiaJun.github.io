                        done during Hackathon, left displeased in general because of how loud
                        the place was(our room is right beside the rest zone) since i don't do

                        went decently on my end, have many features that i still need to implement
                        such as currency and balance issues, we stumbled on presentation but i
                        felt like that was to be expected, especially at the end<br />
                        during the game presentation(no idea why I wasn't presenting that part, since i did basically
                        all the code)

                    <dd>
                        reworked all systems after an idea from the teacher to generate the cards onto
                        a blank template in order to remove all the clutter of old files that are
                        no longer used as well as to make the codes less cluttered and cleared
                        redundant sprites("back" button etc is now text drawn instead of having a
                        sprite,and each individual question rooms is now only one "room_questions"
                        for example), codes also now have comments on what they do.

                        at first, it was confusing because i didn't realise that it stored in the
                        local AppData, but it was a lot easier to understand after a few read/write
                        attempts

                    <dd>
                        Probably the most stressful part of the project thus far, reading the strings
                        from the question and using RNG to decide the questions and print to the room
                        as well as printing individual cards by parsing strings to the object and
                        reading which option is selected to remove the card. It works, but is now facing
                        another possible revamp so it doesn't display the effects.

                        P2/FSD is now over, and i have taken an extra day to gater my opinion on the project.
                        if i were to try and describe it in a sentence, it would be: <br />
                        <u style="text-align:center;">"There was no love for this project"</u>.
                        <br />

                    <dd>
                        due to the team composition, as well as the natural lack of peer coding support, I feel
                        that the never really got to bond into one, maybe because we lacked an extrovert that
                        was capable of tearing down our walls, but by the end, not even the people that made the
                        game was willing to play the game, so it was to be expected that the final product was a
                        flop in my eyes, especially since i can't currently look back at the product and feel any
                        sort of excitement, for that flame already got burnt out a long time ago.<br />

                        what really killed any motivation for me was probably a combination of two factors as well as the final straw:
                        after the initial hackathon presentation,where I asked if there was any feedback for "CitySaviours v1"
                        and was only given the response of "Okay"<br />
                        how i pushed for a "storyboard" before said hackathon and got a wirefrane for "map 1" and nothing else<br />
                        and during th last few days when the "design" portion came in the day before the final presentation with <br />
                        (1)buttons in the same layer as the background<br />
                        (2)backgrounds of different sizes and colours ranging from 500px-1k+px(bright text colours would be obstructed by bright background and vice versa.)<br />
                        (3)missing UI buttons<br />
                        (4)some objects with hardtext(i.e. cards, menu) and some objects that are softtext(i.e. questions)<br />
                        (5)a confession that the designer didn't even bother to look in the "sprites" or "background" folder to see how the images should have looked like<br />

                        Is it an experience? Yes.<br />
                        Do I like how it ended? No, not really.<br />
                        Would I do it all over again if given the chance? If there was any form of passion in it then yes.<br />
