        <dl>
            <dt>very first bases created(v0.01/v-0.02)</dt>
            <dd>
                done during Hackathon, left displeased in general because of how loud
                the place was(our room is right beside the rest zone) since i don't do
                well in noisy situations(i have ADHD)
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>13 Nov 2019</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>first presentation base(v1.0)</dt>
            <dd>
                went decently on my end, have many features that i still need to implement
                such as currency and balance issues, we stumbled on presentation but i
                felt like that was to be expected, especially at the end during the game
                presentation(no idea why I wasn't presenting that part, since i did basically
                all the code)

        <h2>15 Jan 2020</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Massive rework</dt>
            <dd>
                reworked all systems after an idea from the teacher to generate the cards onto
                a blank template in order to remove all the clutter of old files that are
                no longer used as well as to make the codes less cluttered and cleared
                redundant sprites("back" button etc is now text drawn instead of having a
                sprite,and each individual question rooms is now only one "room_questions"
                for example), codes also now have comments on what they do.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        
        <h2>18th Jan 2020</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>worked on generating cards from a .text file</dt>
            <dd>
                at first, it was confusing because i didn't realise that it stored in the
                local AppData, but it was a lot easier to understand after a few read/write
                attempts
            </dd>
        </dl>

        
        <h2>20th Jan 2020</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>RNG system</dt>
            <dd>
                Probably the most stressful part of the project thus far, reading the strings
                from the question and using RNG to decide the questions and print to the room
                as well as printing individual cards by parsing strings to the object and
                reading which option is selected to remove the card. It works, but is now facing
                another possible revamp so it doesn't display the effects.
